This folder is broken up into four sections: Data manipulation which contains all the code to make the features used from the original data set in python, logistic regression code for Y1 in matlab, naive bayes for Y2 in python and linear regression in python. Each of these folders run independently from one another and include their respective readme files. The results are in Predictions.csv in the main part of this folder as well as realData.csv which was used for the predicitions and trainingData.csv which was used for training. The only difference between these two data sets is trainingData uses 2014 data and realData uses 2015 data. How these were created can be found in the Data Manipulation folder.
